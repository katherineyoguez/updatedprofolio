                      <p>Priateship was the first group porject I was apart of. Myself and my team were asked to create anything we would like that included HTML, CSS, Javascript, API's and Localstorage. We decide to create our own tradition battleship and renamed ours Priateship. We work together as a team and gave each person their own task. We used github to merge all of our code toegther.</p>

        <a href="https://katherineyoguez.github.io/workscheduler/"><img class="resize" src="assets/images/workscheduler.png" alt="Scheduler"></a>
                    <p>As an employee with a busy schedule, I want to add important events to a daily planner so  can manage my time effectively. When the planner is opened, the current day is displayed at the top of the calender. The planner timeblock is standard business hours. Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present or future. When timeblock is selected and event is entered, saved button is clicked then the text for that event is save in local storage. When paged is refreshed, the saved events persist. I created this program by using HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery and Localstorage.</p>
